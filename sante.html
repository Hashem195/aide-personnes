            <div class="text">The Courtesan (after Eisen)
                While in Paris, Van Gogh was exposed to a myriad of artistic styles, including the Japanese Ukiyo-e
                woodblock prints. These prints were only made available in the West in the mid-19th century. Van Gogh
                collected works by Japanese ukiyo-e masters like Hiroshige and Hokusai and claimed these works were as
                important as works by European artists, like Rubens and Rembrandt. Van Gogh was inspired to create this
                particular painting by a reproduction of a print by Keisai Eisen that appeared on the May 1886 cover of
                the magazine Paris Illustré. Van Gogh enlarges Eisen's image of the courtesan</div>

            <div class="text">Café Terrace at Night, 1888 This painting of a colorful outdoor view is a picturesque
                work, the vision of a relaxed
                spectator who enjoys the charm of his surrounding without any moral concern. It recalls Van Gogh's mood
                when he wrote that "the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day." The color is more
                profuse and the eye wanders along the steeped or dove-tailed edges of neighboring areas - irregular
                shapes fitted to each other like a jigsaw puzzle design. To divide this space for long into a large
                object and background themes is difficult for the eyes</div>

                was painted only
                months before his death.

                The compulsive, restless all over ornament of the background, recalling the work of mental patients, is
                for some physicians evidence that the painting was done in a psychotic state. But the self-image of the
                painter shows a masterly control and power of observation, a mind perfectly capable of integrating the
                elements of its chosen activity</div>

            <div class="text">Noon - Rest from Work (after Millet) In the autumn of 1889 and into 1890 Van Gogh embarked
                on a series of paintings taken from his collection of prints that included Jean Millet, Eugene
                Delacroix, Rembrandt, and Gustave Moreau. It was a period when the artist was lacking in inspiration
                from external motifs - he had been at the asylum at Saint-Remy since May - and he was profoundly
                depressed. He once again turned to peasant subjects, and painted this picture after Millet's. The prints
                from which he worked were black and white, and consequently Van Gogh had to devise his own colour
                system, which undoubtedly he would have done anyway. Van Gogh often copied the works of Millet, whom he
                considered to be "a more modern painter than Manet".</div>

                psychological questions. They have been seen as symbolizing Van Gogh's difficult passage through life.

                A fellow student in Paris reported that Vincent bought these workman's boots at a flea market, intending
                to use them in a still life. Finding them still a little too smart, however, he wore them on a long and
                rainy walk. Only then were they fit to be painted.</div>

            <div class="text">Pieta (after Delacroix) At the time Van Gogh pointed this he was suffering a period of
                tormented religious dreams, and it is probable that this Pieta was as a result of this. Ironically, the
                print of Delacroix's work that he had was in black and white and therefore denied the artist the one
                element that he was so influenced by. As a consequence Van Gogh's Pieta was based on an assimilation of
                his interpretation of colour, and recollections of Delacroix's colouring from originals he had seen
                previously.</div>

                Brabant cottages with lighted windows, a tall, solitary cypress. But there is no church; the theme has
                been 'secularized'. It is just a landscape with cottages, trees, wheatfields and workers. It signifies a
                decisive retrenchment and a rejection of his flirtation with the Paris vanguard.</div>

                by Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet who took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his
                life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers. Both
                show Doctor Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm but they are easily
                differentiated in color and style. In 1890, the first version fetched a record price of $82.5 million
                ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission) when sold at auction in New York. When accounting
                for inflation, this is still the highest price paid for art at a public auction.</div>

                same month that incorporate the night sky and stars as fundamentally symbolic elements. He also painted
                Cafe Terrace at Night, and a portrait of his friend Eugene Boch which was perhaps the most symbolic of

                Starry Night depicts a dreamy interpretation of the artist's asylum room's sweeping view of
                Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Though Van Gogh revisited this scene in his work on several occasions, "Starry
                Night" is the only nocturnal study of the view. Thus, in addition to descriptions evident in the myriad
                of letters he wrote to his brother, Theo, it offers a rare nighttime glimpse into what the artist saw
                while in isolation. "Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure,"
                he wrote in May of 1889, "above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory."</div>
